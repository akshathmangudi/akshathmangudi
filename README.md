deep neural nets are fun! 

currently I am working on picograd - a barebone deep learning library to build neural networks. Definitely did not take inspiration from Hotz and Karpathy :D 

I'm learning cython and numba, to optimize my python code and make it run faster. 

email me @ akkshathmangudi@gmail.com if you would like to work with me.

deep neural nets are fun! 

currently I am working on picograd - a barebones deep learning library to build neural networks. Definitely did not take inspiration from Hotz and Karpathy :D 

I'm also tinkering around with cython and numba to make my code faster.

email me @ akshathmangudi@gmail.com if you would like to work with me.

thought to leave you with...
are you really someone who appreciates deep learning if you didn't have an epiphany over transformers?
